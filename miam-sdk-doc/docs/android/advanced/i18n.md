# Internationalisation - I18n

This section is about how we can define localised content in the context of the Miam SDK.

### Override Miam SDK values

You can override Miam SDK's localised content. However, the mechanism is different for each platform. 

Let's assume that the Miam SDK embed the following localisation string:

```xml
<resources>
    <string name="com_miam_i18n_recipe_add">Add ingredients</string>
</resources>
```

On Android, it is fairly simple to override resources that come from a library. Just declare values with the same identifier, and it's done. 


In your application, just add the following string declaration inside a `res/values(-LANG)/<FILENAME>.xml` (the filename doesn't matter) to override it:

```xml
<resources>
    <string name="com_miam_i18n_recipe_add">Add recipe to basket</string>
</resources>
```

When consuming `com_miam_i18n_recipe_add`, you should see **Add recipe to basket** instead of **Add ingredients**.
