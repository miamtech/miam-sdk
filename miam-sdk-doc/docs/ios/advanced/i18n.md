# Internationalisation - I18n

This section is about how we can define localised content in the context of the Miam SDK.

### Override Miam SDK values

Overriding localisation on ios is a little big trickier. 
First thing is to create a new entry in your `Localizable.strings` file, to provide your localisation:

```text
// Localizable.strings
"com_miam_i18n_recipe_add" = "Add recipe to basket"
```

Then, as Moko is reading localisations from a Bundle, that by default is the Miam SDK's bundle, you need to register your app's bundle on the `I18nResolver` before consuming any override resources.

```swift
I18nResolver.shared.registerAppBundle(Bundle.main)
```

After that, consuming `com_miam_i18n_recipe_add` on iOS, should display **Add recipe to basket** instead of **Add ingredients**.
